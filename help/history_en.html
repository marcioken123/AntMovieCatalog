  <li>3.6.0 Unofficial (27/07/2011) by Mickaël Vanneufville
    <ul>
      <li> Grouping has been improved to take into account the different values of following multiple fields: <br />
      MediaType, Source, Director, Producer, Country, Category, Actors, VideoFormat, AudioFormat, Languages, Subtitles <br />
      The separator (',' default) can be changed in options menu.<br />
      If a separator is placed in brackets, then it is ignored.
      If an error is detected in parentheses, the movie will be added to the group '&lt; ?()? &gt;'.<br />
      For actors field, the information in brackets is removed from the group name.<br />
      It is possible to remove information in brackets for all multiple fields in options menu.<br />
      Also given the number of (I (II (III (IV ... (XXX to denote an actor, I added a patch (active or not in options menu) to disregard this parenthesis in this case.<br />
      </li>
      <li> Grouping has been improved in the same way for statistics and fields Director, Producer and Actors has been added.</li>
      <li> The sort of movies on different fields in table mode has been improved.</li>
      <li> The sort of groups are now always done alphabetically from A to Z or the number of movies in groups (choice in options menu).</li>
      <li> Ability to display the list (table mode or not) across the width of the screen.</li>
      <li> Ability to perform the same actions that are either in list or table mode.</li>
      <li> Can limit the number of characters displayed in table mode in the options menu to speed up the scrolling list (32 characters by default).<br />
      Fields FormattedTitle, OriginalTitle and TranslatedTitle are not affected by this limitation.</li>
      <li> Improved display of selected movie in the list when the sort criteria change.</li>
      <li> Keep in mind the sort order for display in list mode AND table mode.</li>
      <li> Added keyboard shortcut CTRL+T to expand all movies in groups and CTRL+SHIF+T to collapse them.</li>
      <li> Added random button to select a movie in the list randomly.</li>
      <li> The problem that prevented to clear the date on some operating systems (Windows Vista, 7) has been fixed.</li>
      <li> Added a HTML viewer to display information of movies according to HTML template selected (HTMLDefaultTemplate.html by default).</li>
      <li> In HTML, the search terms are selected in bold red.</li>
      <li> Information of movie selected in the list is no longer directly updated when the user changes a character, because this operation takes a lot of time when there are many movies in the list.<br />
      The information of the selected movie is updated if necessary when:
        <ul>
          <li> The user moves the mouse over the list, or the left area of the panel FrmMovie (X <90).</li>
          <li> The user presses enter or escape key in a field (entrer key is ignored for fields Description and Comments).</li>
          <li> The user clicks on the header of a column, the button to stretch the list.</li>
          <li> The user pastes the information from a movie after a copy or cancels the changes.</li>
          <li> Otherwise update are managed in the function SaveCurrentItem (e.g change the selected movie, adding a new film).</li>
        </ul>

        like this unit and having a .pas or .ifs extension in the same folder.</li>

      <li>Export, Print, Statistics and Script windows now have an option to include all movies, or only the selected, checked or visible ones.</li>
      <li>Separated language window displayed the first time that the program is launched; I hope that I will receive less e-mails of people
        asking how to switch the program to French ;)</li>
      <li>Virtual field "Formatted Title" that can be used in sorting, so it is now possible to sort properly on the translated title. The "checked" field
        (checkboxes of the main window's list) has been added in the available fields too.</li>
      <li>"Rating" field can now have one decimal like on IMDB.</li>
      <li>Field names can be used in printed reports, so they are translated too (usage: [label:fieldname] where "fieldname" is the same as what you use to
        display one of the movie value).</li>
      <li>Duplicate movie numbers are accepted (and for those that still want unique numbers, I added in the "Add movie" window some actions available in the
        case the new number already exists).</li>
