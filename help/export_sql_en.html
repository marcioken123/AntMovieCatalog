<p class="title">Export to SQL</p>
<hr />
<p>This isn't really a file format, but this export option will allow you to generate all the SQL commands useful to import easily the movie list in a database.</p>
<p>The primary idea was creating a mySQL database, viewable with a PHP page, because it would be much more interactive than an HTML page for the people that want to see your movie list if you put it on the web.</p>
<p>The SQL export will create a table (movies by default) containing movies with the values of the selected fields.
  The movie number is automatically added because it is the primary key of the table.
  Then the movie numbers have to be unique for each movie to have a valid SQL export.
  You can easily renumber your movies if needed or if you are not sure to have a unique number for each movie.</p>
<p>If you export the movie extras, another table will be created (extras by default) containing movie extras with the values of the selected fields.
   The extra number and the movie number are automatically added because they are the primary key of the table.
   The extra numbers are always unique so you don't have to worry about this here.</p>
<p>If you enable the export of movie pictures, a "PICTURENAME" field will be added in table of movies, containing the filename of the movie picture.</p>
<p>If you enable the export of extra pictures, a "PICTURENAME" field will be added in table of extras, containing the filename of the extra picture.</p>
<p>There is an option to generate UPDATE queries instead of INSERT queries, if you want to update information without first deleting existing data.
  It updates the movies on the basis of their number, so it may cause problem if you modify the numbers of some movies.
  Also, if you export extras, the old movie extras will be deleted before to add the new ones.</p>
