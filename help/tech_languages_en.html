<p class="title">Language files</p>
<hr />
<p>The language files use a syntax similar to INI files. They are just plain text
  files, so you can edit them with any text editor, such as Windows' Notepad.</p>
<p>The file contains sections. A section is a name between brackets. The section
  names are application's windows names.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>e.g.: <code>[MainWindow]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under that, you find all the items corresponding to the specified window. These
  items are pairs of attributes and values.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>e.g.: <code>Attribute=Value</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attributes are the paths to the component to translate, and the value is the new text to display. The path is build with the component name,
  a dot, then the property to modify ("component.property"). For some items there are components inside components. Sometimes there are arrays,
  so there is an index in square brackets. For window properties there is only a property name alone.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>e.g. for [ExportWin] section:</p>
  <p><code>Caption=Export to another file format</code> // caption of
    the Exportation window <br />
    <code>btn1.Caption=Help</code> // caption of the first button of
    the Exportation window<br />
    <code>Messages.Strings.String[0]=Unable to save</code> // first
    message of the messages list of the Exportation window</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The component names use &quot;standard&quot; names.</p>
<p>Buttons begin with &quot;btn&quot;, Actions (menu/toolbar items) begin with
  &quot;Action&quot;, Checkboxes begin with &quot;CB&quot;, Radiobuttons begin
  with &quot;RB&quot;, labels begin with L or LH, Entry fields begin with E, etc...</p>
<p>The base window dialog can have 0 to 4 buttons, called btn1, btn2, btn3, btn4; where
  btn1 is the button in the lower right corner.<br />
</p>
<p>Tooltips are stored in the "Hint" properties. In these properties, there can be two different strings, separated by the character "|". 
    The first part is used for the actual tooltip, the second part is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the current window.
    In general it is better to avoid tooptips for input fields, so the Hint property of these should only have contents after the "|".
</p>
<p>A comment line begins with a semicolon (;) and is ignored by the program.</p>
<p>There is a special section that is used to display information in the language selection window:</p>
<p>
<code>[FileInformation]</code><br />
<code>Icon=</code> A 16x16 bitmap image (4-bit color), MIME-encoded<br />
<code>Name=</code> Name of the language, in English<br />
<code>LocalName=</code> Name of the language translated in the language itself<br />
<code>Version=</code> Version of the program for which the contents was translated (if lower than the VersionFormat, it means that parts are still in English)<br />
<code>VersionFormat=</code> Version of the program for which the file structure is made<br />
<code>Comments=</code> Free text (linebreaks = "|", link = &lt;link&gt;address&lt;/link&gt;)<br />
<code>Authors=</code> Name and e-mail addresses of the translators (each name/address is separated by a "|": name1|addr1|name2|addr2)<br />
</p>
<p>If you want to be notified of translation errors, you can launch the program with the <code>/tr_show_errors</code> parameter.</p>
