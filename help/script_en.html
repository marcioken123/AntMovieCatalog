<p class="title">Scripting</p>
<hr />
<p>With this module you can get movie information from internet and import them
  into your catalog, or apply a script to a movie list.</p>
<p>When the window is called by "Get information" -&gt; "From Internet using a script"
  menu, the only visible scripts are those made for version 3.5 (at least) and that
  were defined as getting information from Internet. By default the script is
  applied to selected movies. When it is called by "Scripting" menu, all the scrips
  are displayed.</p>
<p>You may want to display only some scripts. This choice is done on the basis of the
  language defined in scripts' properties. It is the language of the information
  that the script imports. So this is more applicable to the scripts that get information
  from Internet. This filtering is done through the "Language filter" menu.</p>
<p>To start a script, click on the "Run" button, or double-click on
  its name in the displayed list, or press Enter or F9.</p>
<p>The "Movies to include" options allows to restrict the script to selected movies,
  checked movies (that is linked to the "<a href="options_en.html#movielist">Checkboxes</a>"
  option) or visible movies (when using the "Display results" option of main window's search
  function).</p>
<p>The script is executed for each movie corresponding to this criteria. After each execution,
  a summary window shows the old and new values (if the "Show results" option is enabled). By
  default the only checked fields are those that have been modified by the script.</p>
<p>You can define which fields the script can modify using the "Modifiable fields" list.</p>
<p>If you click "Save" in the results window, the new values for checked fields will be kept.
  If you click "Save all", the window will not be shown for next movies. The program will ask you
  if you want it to remember which fields were checked by you, or if you prefer that this is
  done automatically depending of which fields have been modified by the script.</p>
<p>Warning: if the "Allow to clear fields" option is enabled, a field that as an empty value as
  new value will erase the old contents if it is checked.</p>
  <p>The "Skip" button allows to go to the next movie without modifying the current one.
  The "Abort" button stops script execution (the movies already modified will keep their
  changes).</p>
<p>If the "Close this window at end" is enabled, the script window will close, except
  if you clicked on "Abort" or if there was an error in the script.</p>
<p>If the script provides it, some options are displayed in the "Script options" list. 
  Double-click on an option to change it.</p>
<p>When importing from internet, if more than one movie is found (that can be very common on some
  sites) you will get a list asking you to select the right movie. For some scripts you will 
  also have to select one value in a list for a field (e.g. several movie summaries may be 
  available).</p>

  files creation</a> page in the Technical information section.</p>
