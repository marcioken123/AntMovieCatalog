<p class="title">Export to CSV</p>
<hr />
<p>CSV is a text file format which is really useful since many program allow to load and save such files (e.g. Microsoft Excel).</p>
<p>In these files each item is on one line, and all the fields of an item are separated by a character (usually comma or semicolon).</p>
<p>Date fields will be formatted as 'yyyy-mm-dd'.</p>
<p>If you enable the picture export, a "Picture" column will be added, containing the file name of the picture.</p>
<p>If you export an extra field, the values of the same field of each extra will be concatenated and separated by &lt;+&gt; by default.</p>
<p>If you enable the export of extra pictures, a "EPicture" column will be added, containing the file names of the pictures separated by &lt;+&gt; by default.</p>
