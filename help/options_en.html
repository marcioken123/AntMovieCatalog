<blockquote>
  <p>Icon set: Allows you to select the "theme" of the icons that will
    appear in the toolbars. These themes are simple bitmap (".bmp")
    stored in the "Toolbars" folder. Some sets are provided with the program.</p>
  <p>Color type: Specifies how toolbar icons should appear when mouse is not
    over them. Available values are "Automatic", "Greyed when inactive" (Windows
    98/2000 style), "Blended light when inactive" (Office/Windows XP
    style), "Blended dark when inactive" or "Always colored".</p>
  <p>Office XP style: Gives to menus and toolbars the same appearence than in
    Microsoft Office XP.</p>
  <p>Images in menus: Display images on the left of menu items. These images
    are the same as the images used in the toolbar.</p>
  <p>Soft borders for Movie List, Movie Information Panel and Picture Box: When
    enabled, the specified items in the main window appear with a "less lowered"
    border than usual. This may look better if you are using Windows XP with a visual theme.</p>
  <p>Display logo: Application logo (splash screen) is displayed at startup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle" id="customizetoolbar">Customize toolbar</p>

<p class="subtitle" id="files">Files</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Always create a backup copy: Each time the catalog is saved, the old file
    is renamed as ".bak".</p>
  <p>At statup, automatically open...: Allows you to specify a file to open instead
    of creating a new file at startup. The option "Re-open last used file"
    opens last used file instead of specified file.</p>
  <p>Number of recent files to display in menu: Last files that you used are
    displayed in the "File" menu, above the "Exit" item, to
    allow you to quickly re-open these files. You can select here the number of
    filenames that have to be stored in the history.</p>
  <p>Repair files associations: Rewrites to Windows' registry values that allow
    to open .amc files with ANSYsoft Movie Catalog by double-clicking on then.</p>
  <p>Automatically import custom fields from a file for new catalogs : When you create a new catalog,
    the custom fields of selected file will be automatically added.</p>
  <p>Store loans history: Records all loan changes (in/out) in a text file, using
    a tab-delimited format (so you can open it with programs such as Microsoft Excel).
    By default the file is stored in the application's folder, and is called "Loans history.csv".
    The same file is shared by all instances of Ant Movie Catalog so you can have
    problems if you use the loans window in several instances (this will be corrected
    later).</p>
  <p>HTML Template: HTML Template file used for HTML display.
    By default the file is stored in the templates folder, and is called "HTMLDefaultTemplate.html".
    You can change the file with other HTML template.
    See <a href="export_html_en.html">this page</a> for more informations on HTML templates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Checkboxes: If this option is enabled, checkboxes will be displayed in the
    movie list in the main window (Left click to check/uncheck, right click to change color tag of movie).
    The use of these checkboxes is free: e.g. they can
    be used to indicate which movies you've seen, which ones you already have, or anything
    else. These checkboxes can be used as filter for exportation, printing or scripting.</p>
  <p>Checkboxes in thumbnails display: If this option is enabled, checkboxes will be displayed under
    the thumbnails of movies in the main window when thumbnails display is selected
    (Left click to check/uncheck, right click to change color tag of movie).</p>
  <p>Checkboxes with background color : If this option is enabled, checkboxes will be displayed with background color associated to color tag of movie .</p>
  <p>Lines with background color : If this option is enabled, lines of movie list will be displayed with background color associated to color tag of movie.</p>
  <p>Hot track: Underlines items of the lists when mouse passes over them.</p>
  <p>Enhanced scrollbars: Uses enhanced scrollbars for Main Window and Loans Window lists.</p>
  <p>"Movie Number" column: Shows or hides the column containing the movie numbers on the left of
    the titles in main window. If you do not use the numbers, hiding this column makes more
    space available on the screen for other info.</p>
  <p>Number of characteres by section in grid mode: Set the number of characteres to display by section in grid mode
  (The sections FormatedTitle, OriginalTitle and TranslatedTitle are not affected).
  By default, the number of characteres is set to 32.
  To remove this limitation on all sections, put 0 but grid display can be much slower.</p>
  <p>Auto stretch list in grid mode view: If this option is enabled, the list is stretch automatically when you select/deselect grid mode view.</p>
  <p>Auto stretch list in thumbnails view: If this option is enabled, the list is stretch automatically when you select/deselect thumbnails view.</p>
  <p>Confirm Delete: Ask for confirmation before deleting a movie from the list.</p>
  <p>Confirm Undo: Ask for confirmation before undoing changes made to a movie.</p>
  <p>Shortcuts, Previous/Next movie: Allows you to define a shortcut to jump
    to previous or next movie without losing the focus of the current field.
    It is useful to modify one field accross lots of movies without needing to
    use mouse to select next movie. Default key is Ctrl + Page Up/Down, which
    is the same as Ctrl + Numeric pad 9/3.</p>
  <p class="subtitle" id="formattedtitle">Title formatting</p>
  <blockquote>

        the original title is displayed.</li>
      <li>Label: Displays the contents of Media label field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Put the following prefixes at the end: You can specify here the list of
      prefixes that will be placed at the end of the movie name (e.g. "The
      Matrix" will become "Matrix, The"). By default the list has
      English and French prefixes.<br />
      Simply enter the prefixes, one per line, without space or quote (a prefix
      will be recognized if, in the movie title, it is followed by a space or a
      quote). <br />
      I will not included other langues for the moment, because it can cause problems,
      e.g. "Die" in German ("The") will display the movie "Die
      hard" as "Hard, Die", which is not correct. But you can change
      the prefixes yourself to make them match to your language.</p>

      refreshing the list.</p>
    <p>Make groups with values in multi field separated by: Set the separator between the different values of a multi field
    (MediaType, Source, Director, Producer, Writer, Composer, Actors, Country, Category, Certification, VideoFormat, AudioFormat, Languages, Subtitles).

  <p>Ask for number: When a adding a movie, a window will allow you to select
    the number of the new movie. If the option is disabled the number of the movie
    will be the default value, which is highest movie number + 1, except if you
    change the next option:</p>
  <p>Use first available ...: Will use as default number the first available

  <p>Background Color (Picture): Allows you to select which color should be used as background
    of the Picture Window. e.g. It may look better with a white background if
    your images are made to be used on a web page with white background. Defaut
    value is BtnFace, which corresponds to the color of Windows' dialogs and buttons.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Same options for all lists: Keeps the same options for all the lists.</p>
    <p>Auto-sort items: Sort list contents alphabetically</p>
    <p>Auto-complete while typing: If enabled, when you type text in a drop-down
      list in the main window there will be a "suggestion" of a matching
      value, like when you type an address in a web browser. This feature may
      cause problems if you have several items that are similar.</p>
    <p>Use values of current catalog instead of predefined lists: Does not use
      the values entered for the lists, but searchs in the current catalog for
      values to display in the lists.</p>
    <p>Automatically add values not in list: If the contents of a field is not

  </blockquote>
  <p class="subtitle" id="pictureimport">Picture importation</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Importing pictures from external sources: When you import an image, there are several ways to
      associate it to the movie or extra:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store picture into catalog: Keeps the picture file inside the catalog; this works only when 
        the catalog uses the ".amc" format and not ".xml". Depending of the size of the pictures, this may
        create a very large catalog, so it will use more memory and take more time to load. With large pictures
        I really recommend to not use this option.</li>
      <li>Copy picture to catalog folder, and link it to catalog: Copies the picture file to the folder where
        the catalog is stored, and then creates a relative link to the picture (so it only stores the picture
        name).</li>
      <li>Copy picture to pictures folder of catalog, and link it to catalog: Copies the picture file to the pictures folder
        (Catalog name + '_pics') where the catalog is stored, and then creates a relative link to the picture
        (so it only stores the folder name and the picture name).</li>
      <li>Only link picture: Only stores the path to the file in the catalog. The "Make relative path" option
        can be used if the catalog folder and the pictures folder are near, for example if the catalog is in
        "my documents\catalogs\movies.amc" and the pictures in "my documents\my pictures\posters". This allows
        you to not care about where are the folders "catalogs" and "my pictures". On the other side, if you want
        to be able to move the catalog without moving the pictures, you shoud rather not use relative paths.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The same options are displayed in the "Select picture" window.</p>
    <p>The third option is not available for scripts in the current version since only "local" links (against
      "internet" links) are possible.</p>
    <p>The pictures stored in the same folder than the catalog are supposed to "belong" to the catalog and so they
      are deleted when they are not used anymore by a movie (e.g. if you associate a new picture to a movie,
      the old one is not useful anymore). If you do not want this behavious, I recommend you to manually
      place pictures e.g. in a "Pictures" subfolder when you want to add them to the catalog, and then
      use the relative links to keep the catalog and their images "movable".</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="subtitle" id="searchinternet">Search on internet</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This allows you to customize the "Search on internet" menu. It
      contains the addresses of websites. When you select an item of the menu,
      it launches the browser to go to the site. It inserts current movie's title
      where you put a "%s" in the URL.</p>
    <p>You can also use other movie fields in address using keyword [FieldTag] instead of "%s"
      where FieldTag is the tag of the field to insert.
      The list of the fields is directly available in the drop down list just
      at right of the input field address.<br />
      Ex 1: [TranslatedTitle] to use the value of the field translated title.<br />
      Ex 2: [EAN] to use the value of the custom field EAN if there.</p>
    <p>Names have to be unique. If you want to put separators you have to begin
      their name with a "-" ; then the address is ignored.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle" id="scripting">Scripting</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Auto-run last script used: Runs the last used script when the scripting window is opened
    through the "Get information from script" command.</p>
  <p>Use proxy when accessing to internet: Allows you to specify proxy server
    information if needed.</p>
  <p>Keep connection alive: By default the connection is closed after each request (page or picture).
    If this option is checked, the connection will not be automatically closed. This may a little speed up the
    speed of the web requests, but I kept this as an option because lots of people had problems when the connection
    was kept open. If you get error messages like "Connection closed gracefully" when activated, do not use this option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle" id="export">Export</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Automatically reload last used template: Keeps the name of the opened template
    so it will be open next time the window is shown.</p>
  <p>Line breaks will be replaced by ...: Allows you to modify the tag used to
    insert line breaks. Since it is the only tag that the program does not take
    from the template, you can define it here. If you want to use HTML you will
    probably use the default &lt;br&gt; tag, but you may want to use &lt;br /&gt;
    for XHTML or XML. You can also simply leave this field empty if you do not want
    to remplace linebreaks by something else.</p>
  <p>Force picture size by adding attributes: Allows to specify a value for HTML attributes
    height &amp; width for movie and extra pictures. If you leave one of these fields (or both) blanks,
    the attribute will not be added.</p>
  <p>SQL Date format: Allows to define which format has to be used for the date
    when exporting to SQL commands. If you leave the field empty, Windows' default
    short date format will be used. Mask characters are those used in Delphi:
    yy and yyyy = year (on 2 or 4 digits), m and mm = month (without or with leading 0),
    d and dd = day (without or with leading 0), and characters than should stay unchanged must be
    enclosed in quotes (e.g.: yyyy'/'mm'/'dd).</p>
  <p>Remember filename of last exported file: Use last file name as default instead
    of catalog name.</p>
  <p>Open exported file when export finished: Launch created file after export.</p>
  <p>Individual pages and pictures filename style: Allows to specify how the program has
    to create to filenames of the multiple files that come with the exported file.</p>
  <p>
    Example, if you export the file "My movies.amc" to "My list.html":</p>
  <blockquote>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td style="font-style: italic;">Exported filename + Movie number</td>
        <td style="font-style: italic;">Catalog name + Movie number</td>
        <td style="font-style: italic;">Movie title</td>
        <td style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>my list.html</td>
        <td>my list.html</td>
        <td>my list.html</td>
        <td>Full list</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>my list_1.html</td>
        <td>my movies_1.html</td>
        <td>matrix.html</td>
        <td>First movie</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>my list_2.html</td>
        <td>my movies_2.html</td>
        <td>starwars - episode one.html</td>
        <td>Second movie</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>etc...</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Extension to append: Allows to force another extension for the individual files.
    This may be usefull if for example your main list is a .html file, but you want .php
    files for each individual movie pages. If this field is blank the main file extension
    is used for individual files.</p>
  <p>Add zeroes in front of low numbers: If enabled, small numbers will be left-padded with
    zeroes so they are properly sorted with all file managers (only Windows XP Explorer
    seems to detect numbers in filenames for sorting).</p>
  <p>Copy pictures to the same folder than the exported file: Extracts or copy
    pictures from catalog to the same folder than the exported file.</p>
  <p>Copy pictures into a subfolder pictures: Extracts or copy
    pictures from catalog to a subfolder pictures (exported file name + '_pics') in the same folder than the exported file
    instead of copy pictures directly in the same folder than the exported file.</p>
  <p>Copy only if target file does not exist: If enabled, the image of a movie or an extra
    will not be copied if the filename of this image already exists (only filename
    is compared, so the image will not be overwritten even if it is different).</p>
  <p>Include extra pictures: Include the extraction or copy of extra pictures in addition to movie pictures.</p>
